# ReadTheDocs Documentation

This repository holds a short study of how to build [ReadTheDocs documentation](https://about.readthedocs.com/) and deploy it as a GitHub page.
The reference I used is [_How to document your research software_](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/).

This branch illustrates the common case where the source code is in the `src` directory while the documentation source code is in `docs`.
The API documentation is not generated with the `autodoc2` extension but rather with `autodoc` (using `.. autofunction:: ...`).
